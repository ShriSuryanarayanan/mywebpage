 <h2> How to play the sport?? </h2>
   <p> Playing the sport is actually really simple... unless you want to play professionally but first let's get to the simple rules. 
    There are three main formats of cricket: test, T20I and ODI. These are determined by the number of overs in each match. The easiest format to understand is T20I so let's start with that. 
     The "I" in T20I means international and is only applicable for when countries are playing against each other because then it becomes an international game. 
    Other than that, it is just a T20. A T20 is a game that has 20 overs per side. Each over has 6 balls. At the start of the game, there is a toss which works like any other toss.
    The two team captains assemble and the winner of the toss gets to decide whether they want to bat first or field first. Let's start with the fielding team. This team enters the field/stadium first.
    and the captain decides where each player is positioned. <img src= "https://www.itsonlycricket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cricket-Fielding-Positions-Explained.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:370x370/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" >
